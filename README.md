# Introduction

This project runs through an FPGA implementation of the [Roberts Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberts_cross "RC") operation for Edge Detection on an image. It is a discrete differential operator that approximates the gradient of an image. Two images, a blackbuck and junkyard boeing plane are used to show the simulation results of a synthesizable rtl Roberts Cross module.  

It is untested in hardware. <!--TODO : maybe try to test in hardware, time permitting-->
